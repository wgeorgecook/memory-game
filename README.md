## Instructions

Click a card to reveal it's icon. Flip another and try for a match!
If the two cards are identical, you're in luck! Keep going for another. 
Unmatched cards both get flipped over. Flip over cards until all pairs
are together and you win the game! Keep trying to get a higher star rating
or to beat your best time.
